* curbside-clojure-ml

=curbside-clojure-ml= is a library used to train and optimize models, as well as to make predictions. It implements the following ML algorithms:
- =lsvm=
- =svm=
- =c4=
- =random-forest=
- =m5p=
- =xgboost=

** Usage

From your application code, you will need to require the =models= interface:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[curbside.ml.models])
#+END_SRC

The =model= namespace offers the following interface, based on the provided algorithm keyword (i.e. =:xgboost=)

- save
- load
- dispose
- train
- evaluate
- optimize-hyperparameters
- infer

** Releasing to Artifactory

We use [[lein-release][https://github.com/relaynetwork/lein-release]] to release artifacts to Artifactory. To use:

1. Export =GITHUB_ACTOR= and =GITHUB_TOKEN=. You can generate a token from your own account settings with the =write:packages= permission.
2. Make sure you are on the master branch, and that its remote branch is set to the primary source repository (https://github.com/Curbside/curbside-clojure-ml).
3. Make sure that your code is detangled correctly from org files with =make clean && make tangle=
4. We use [[semantic versioning][https://semver.org]] to describe releases, so make sure to update the version accordingly in =project.clj=
5. Release a new version with =lein deploy release=
